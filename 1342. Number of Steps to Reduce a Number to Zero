Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.



class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
            return helper(num,0);
    }

    public int helper(int num,int step){
        if(num == 0){
            return step;
        }

        if(num%2 == 0){
            return helper(num/2,step+1);
        }
        return helper(num-1,step+1);
    }
}
